# URLGenerator.java
This program combines various Java language features, GUI interactions, and standard libraries to achieve the functionality of generating and validating URLs based on specific rules.

Here is a list of features and resources used in the provided Java program:

**Features:**

**URLGenerator Class:**
1. Private instance variables to store company-related information and computation results.
2. Getter and setter methods for the company name.
3. The `compute()` method for generating the URL based on specified rules.
4. Validation of URL format and components.
5. Use of loops for iterating through characters in the company name.
6. String manipulation methods such as `toLowerCase()`, `replace()`, and `charAt()`.

**URLGeneratorApp Class:**
1. Utilization of JOptionPane for user input and output.
2. Dynamic array creation based on user input for storing generated URLs.
3. Instantiation of the `URLGenerator` class to perform URL generation.
4. Looping through user input to generate and store multiple URLs.
5. Displaying the generated URLs using JOptionPane.

**Resources:**
1. `JOptionPane` class for user interaction through GUI dialogs.
2. `StringBuffer` for efficient string manipulation in the `URLGenerator` class.
3. `toLowerCase()`, `replace()`, `charAt()` methods for string manipulation.
4. Arrays for storing and managing multiple URLs and validation results.

**Overall:**
1. Object-oriented programming concepts with the creation of classes (`URLGenerator` and `URLGeneratorApp`).
2. Encapsulation with private instance variables and methods.
3. Modularity with the `compute()` method for URL generation and `computeValidation()` method for URL validation.
4. User input handling for generating and validating multiple URLs.
5. Conditional statements and loops for decision-making and iteration.
6. Use of arrays to store and manage data efficiently.
